## How to contribute

### Did you find a bug?

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/jolpica/jolpica-f1/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/jolpica/jolpica-f1/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, the endpoint returning an unexpected result alongside the expected result.

### Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?

- Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

- Include a minimal test case which would fail before your bugfix, and succeeds afterwards.

### Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?
