## How to contribute

### Did you find a bug?

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/jolpica/jolpica-f1/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/jolpica/jolpica-f1/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, the endpoint returning an unexpected result alongside the expected result.

### Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?

- Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

- Include a minimal test case which would fail before your bugfix, and succeeds afterwards.

- Before submitting, please read the [License](/LICENSE) and [Contributor License Agreement](#contributor-license-agreement) as by contributing and submitting a PR you agree to follow both.

### Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?

- Suggest your change on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/jolpica/jolpica-f1/issues) before writing code, specifying what you intend to contribute.

- We will not accept changes to the ergast compatible api that add new features or break backwards compatibility. 

- Generally we will not accept additions to the database model before a source for the data has been found with an automated ingestion method developed. 

- Before submitting, please read the [License](/LICENSE) and [Contributor License Agreement](#contributor-license-agreement) as by contributing and submitting a PR you agree to follow both. 

# Developing
How to setup the project locally for development.

## Initial Setup
### Prerequisite
Use of the devcontainer is recommended. If not using, we will provide no debugging help,
but please look at `.devcontainer/Dockerfile` for the required installs and versions (e.g. `poetry < 2`>).<br>

Current requirements are:
- Poetry for python (get the version from the devcontainer)
- A postgres database which can be accessed via the `DATABASE_SECRET_URL` environment variable.

### Data Import

  
- Run any initial setup for development (e.g. python dependencies, pre-commit)
  ```
  make setup
  ```
  - If not using the devcontainer, you will need to have the correct poetry version installed and activate the environment first:  
    `source "$(poetry env info -p)"/bin/activate`

- Create all required database tables
  ```
  python manage.py migrate
  ```

- Download a csv dump from our Ko-fi (it's free).  
  They are currently in Alpha and not regularly updated but are good enough for development.

- Place the csv dump in the root of the project (next to the README.md), and rename it to dump.zip

- Run the data import:
  ```
  sh scripts/restore_from_csv_dump.sh localhost jolpica postgres
  ```
    - If using custom database (e.g. not the devcontainer) add the following args to the above command:
       - replace `localhost` with the address of your postgres server
       - replace `jolpica` with the name of the database
       - replace `postgres` with the username used to authenticate
       - export the password for the user to the `PGPASSWORD` environment variable

- Do the initial setup of the test database then run the tests
  ```
  pytest --create-db
  ```
  By default we re-use the same database between tests, and so have to create the initial test database. This is so all future tests will run quicker.

## Running the Server

To run the server

```make run```

This will start jolpica-f1 on port 8000. Once it is running you can access the API via browser, curl or any other tools with `http://localhost:8000/ergast/f1/`. Any changes made to the source code will be automatically updated, while it is running.

## Running Tests
The first time the tests are run it will take upto 2 minutes to populate the database with test data, pytest is configured to reuse this database on future runs, so tests should run much faster on future runs.<br>
To run tests after a migration change you must run with the `--create-db` flag to ensure it uses the new migrations.<br>

To run the tests
```pytest```
