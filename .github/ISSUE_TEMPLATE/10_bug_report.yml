        - Please do not send screenshots of json, provide the data instead.
        - Please provide minimal examples to make the bug easier to understand.
      placeholder: | 
        ex. On f1/9000/1/grid/1/results.json, it returns this snippet:
        ```
        { "position": 1, "driver": "mr slow" }
        ```
        But should return this (As they started in pole despite finishing 4th):
        ```
        { "position": 4, "driver": "miss speedy" }
        ```
