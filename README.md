# jolpica-f1
Jolpica F1 is an open source API for querying Formula 1 data, with backwards compatible endpoints for the soon to be deprecated Ergast API.

Jolpica F1 is maintained by a small group of volunteers. Our hosting costs are around $45 USD per month. If you want to support the project's ongoing development and improvements, please consider [donating to our Kofi]([url](https://ko-fi.com/jolpicaf1)). Our fundraising goal is to be break-even by the start of the 2025 season.

The Ergast compatible API can be found here: http://api.jolpi.ca/ergast/f1/

# Documentation
Our documentation can be [found here](/docs/README.md).

### Ergast Differences
If you are migrating from the Ergast API, please check the known differences [here](/docs/ergast_differences.md).

# Database Scheme
Our database model is not yet finalised and is different to the one used by ergast, this scheme will allow better adaption to changing rulesets, reduce duplication of information, and allow storage of more F1 related data.

Check out our database docs [here](https://dbdocs.io/jolpica/jolpica-f1?view=relationships).

Many Enumerations are used in the database, the mappings of these values are defined in their respective model files. For example you can find the enumerations for the PointSystem table [here](jolpica/formula_one/models/point_scheme.py)
