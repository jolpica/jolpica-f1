# Circuits

Returns a list of circuits in alphabetical order by `circuitId`

**URL** : `/ergast/f1/circuits/`

[Available Query Parameters](/docs/README.md#query-parameters)

---

## Route Parameters

### Season

Filters only circuits which hosted a race in a given season. Year numbers are valid as is `current` to get the current season's list of circuits.

`/{season}/` -> ex: `/ergast/f1/2024/circuits/`

**Note**: To utilize the `season` parameter, it needs to be the first argument after `/ergast/f1/`.

---

### Round

Filters only for the circuit that hosted the race in the specified round of the specific season. Round numbers 1 -> `n` races are valid as well as `last` and `next`.

`/{round}/` -> ex: `/ergast/f1/2024/1/circuits/`

**Note**: **Note**: To utilize the `round` parameter it needs to be used with the `season` filter and be the first argument after `/ergast/f1/{season}`.

---

### circuits

Filters for only the circuit that matches the specified `circuitId`..

`/circuits/{circuitId}/` -> ex: `/ergast/f1/2024/circuits/albert_park/circuits/`

---

### constructors

Filters for only circuits that the specified constructor has participated in a race at.

`/constructors/{constructorId}/` -> ex: `/ergast/f1/constructors/williams/circuits/`

---

### drivers

Filters for only circuits that the specified driver has participated in a race at.

`/drivers/{driverId}/` -> ex: `/ergast/f1/drivers/hamilton/circuits/`


---

### fastest

Filters for a list of circuits where a race finished with a driver completing a lap that was the ranked in the specified position.

`/fastest/{lapRank}/` -> ex: `/ergast/f1/fastest/24/circuits/`


---

### grid

Filters for only circuits that have had a race with a specific grid position.

`/grid/{gridPosition}/` -> ex: `/ergast/f1/grid/29/circuits/`

---

### results

Filters for only circuits that have had a race where a specific finishing position was valid.

`/results/{finishPosition}/` -> ex: `/ergast/f1/results/1/circuits/`

---

### status

Filters for only circuits that have had a race where a driver finished with a specific `statusId`.

`/status/{statusId}/` -> ex: `/ergast/f1/status/2/drivers/`

---
