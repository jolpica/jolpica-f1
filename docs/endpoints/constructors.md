# Constructors

Returns a list of constructors alphabetically by `constructorId`

**URL** : `/ergast/f1/constructors/`

[Available Query Parameters](/docs/README.md#query-parameters)

---

## Route Parameters

### Season

Filters only constructors that participated in a specified season. Year numbers are valid as is `current` to get the current season list of constructors.

`/{season}/` -> ex: `/ergast/f1/2024/constructors/`

**Note**: To utilize the `season` parameter, it needs to be the first argument after `/ergast/f1/`.

---

### Round

Filters only constructors that participated in a specified round of a specific season. Round numbers 1 -> `n` races are valid as well as `last`.

`/{round}/` -> ex: `/ergast/f1/2024/1/constructors/`

**Note**: To utilize the `round` parameter it needs to be used with the `season` filter and be the first argument after `/ergast/f1/{season}/`

---

### circuits

Filters for only constructors who have participated in a race at a given circuit.

`/circuits/{circuitId}/` -> ex: `/ergast/f1/circuits/bahrain/constructors/`

---

### constructors

Filters for only a specified constructor.

`/constructors/{constructorId}/` -> ex: `/ergast/f1/constructors/williams/`

---

### drivers

Filters for only constructors that had a driver race for them.

`/drivers/{driverId}/` -> ex: `/ergast/f1/drivers/hamilton/constructors/`


---

### fastest

Filters for only constructors that finished a race with a lap that was the ranked in the specified position.

`/fastest/{lapRank}/` -> ex: `/ergast/f1/fastest/1/constructors/`


---

### grid

Filters for only constructors which had a driver racing for them start a race in a specific grid position.

`/grid/{gridPosition}/` -> ex: `/ergast/f1/grid/1/constructors/`

---

### results

Filters for only constructors which had a driver racing for them finish a race in a specific position.

`/results/{finishPosition}/` -> ex: `/ergast/f1/results/1/constructors/`

---

### status

Filters for only constructors who had a driver finish a race with a specific `statusId`.

`/status/{statusId}/` -> ex: `/ergast/f1/status/2/constructors/`

---
