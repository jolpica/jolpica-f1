**URL** : `/ergast/f1/qualifying/`

[Available Query Parameters](/docs/README.md#query-parameters)

---

## Route Parameters

### Season

Filters for qualifying results only from a specified season. Year numbers are valid as is `current` to get the current season.

`/{season}/` -> ex: `/ergast/f1/2024/qualifying/`

**Note**: To utilize the `season` parameter, it needs to be the first argument after `/ergast/f1/`.

---

### Round

Filters for the qualifying results for a specified round in a specific season. Round numbers 1 -> `n` races are valid as well as `last` and `next`.

`/{season}/{round}/` -> ex: `/ergast/f1/2024/5/qualifying/`

**Note**: To utilize the `round` parameter it must be combined with a season filter and needs to be the first argument after `/ergast/f1/{season}/`.

---

### circuits

Filters for the qualifying results at a specified circuit.

`/circuits/{circuitId}/` -> ex: `/ergast/f1/circuits/monza/qualifying/`

---

### constructors

Filters for the qualifying results of drivers driving for a specified constructor.

`/constructors/{constructorId}/` -> ex: `/ergast/f1/constructors/williams/qualifying/`

---

### drivers

Filters for the qualifying results of a specified driver.

`/drivers/{driverId}/` -> ex: `/ergast/f1/drivers/hamilton/qualifying/`

---

### grid

Filters for the qualifying results of a driver who started the associated race in a specified grid position.

`/grid/{gridPosition}/` -> ex: `/ergast/f1/grid/18/qualifying/`

**Example**: Pierre Gasly finished Qualifying in 13th for the 2024 Azerbaijan Grand Prix but was disqualified due to instantaneous fuel mass flow limit and started P18 after Ocon and Hamilton. So `/ergast/f1/2024/17/grid/18/qualifying/` would return Gasly's results instead of Zhou who finished Qualifying in P18.

---

### fastest

Filters for the qualifying results a driver with the fastest lap rank at a given Grand Prix.

`/fastest/{lapRank}/` -> ex: `/ergast/f1/fastest/2/qualifying/`

**Example**: If you do `/ergast/f1/2024/17/fastest/1/qualifying/` it will return Lando Norris' qualifying result for the 2024 Azerbaijan Grand Prix as he had the fastest lap in the race, even though he qualified 16th.

---

### status

Filters for the qualifying results of any drivers with the finishing statusId at a given Grand Prix.

`/status/{statusId}/` -> ex: `/ergast/f1/status/11/qualifying/`

---
