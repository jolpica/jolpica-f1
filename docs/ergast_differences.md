# Ergast Differences

## Reporting incompatibilities
Before opening an issue, please ensure the issue is not listed below, or an already existing issue exists.

## Known differences between `jolpica-f1` and `ergast` APIs
These issues are intentional and there are no plans to resolve them.

#### All Endpoints
- XML responses are not supported.
- `jolpica-f1` will ignore all but the the last filter when using duplicates of the same filter, whereas ergast returned a `400` error. (ex. `/2024/drivers/alonso/drivers/hamilton/results.json`)

#### Results
- `positionText` no longer has `N` as a possible value, `R` is used instead.
- `Time.time` will always contain 3 digits after decimal points (using trailing zeros).

#### Standings
- `jolpica-f1` requires a year to be specified.
